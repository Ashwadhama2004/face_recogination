# Face Recognition System with Advanced Features

This project implements a face recognition system in Python with additional features including portrait mode, brightness adjustment, photo capturing, and recording mode. The system can recognize faces in real-time, adjust for lighting conditions, and switch between different modes for capturing and recording images or videos. To use the system, install the necessary libraries, and select the desired mode to begin recognizing and capturing faces efficiently.
